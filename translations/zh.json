	"The preceding report is for illustrative purposes only. The report has been assembled automatically using data reported by a GO device. There are many ways in which automatically-generated reports can be erroneous. Some directly measured quantities in the report, such as acceleration, speed, and GPS location, are subject to their usual uncertainties and measurement errors. Derived quantities, such as the point of impact, are also subject to potential calculation errors. The vehicle image displayed in the document is a generic image of a vehicle and does not serve to portray an accurate image of the exact vehicle or any additions/modifications done to the vehicle such as trailers. This image can also be edited by the user generating the report. This software is still in development and performance characteristics remain uncertain. Accordingly, the report may serve as a starting point for your investigation of an incident, but no conclusions should be drawn from it without a trained Geotab expert to interpret it.": "上述报告仅供参考。报告已通过 GO 设备所提供的数据自动汇总。自动生成的报告可能在多个方面产生错误。报告中的一些直接测量数量（例如，加速度、速度和 GPS 位置），会因其经常性的不确定性和测量误差而受到影响。推断数量，如撞击点，也可能存在计算错误。在文档中显示的车辆图像是车辆的通用图像，并不用于描绘特定车辆的精确图像，或者在对如拖车等车辆所做的任何添加/修改。生成此报告的用户也可编辑该图像。软件仍在开发中，性能特征尚不明确。因此，此报告可以作为事故调查的出发点，但如果未经受过相关培训的 Geotab 专家对其进行说明，不得从中得出任何结论。",
